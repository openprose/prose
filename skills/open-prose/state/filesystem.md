# File-System State Management

This document describes how the OpenProse VM tracks execution state using **files in the `.prose/` directory**.

## Overview

File-based state persists all execution artifacts to disk. This enables:

- **Inspection**: See exactly what happened at each step, including intermediate work
- **Resumption**: Pick up interrupted programs from the last completed service
- **Debugging**: Trace through the manifest, workspace artifacts, and published bindings
- **Auditability**: Every service's full working state is preserved

**Key principle:** Files are inspectable artifacts. The directory structure IS the execution state.

### Run ID Format

Format: `{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS}-{random6}`

Example: `20260317-143052-a7b3c9`

### Segment Numbering

Agent segments use 3-digit zero-padded numbers: `captain-001.md`, `captain-002.md`, etc.

## The Three Directories

The core of Prose state management is the separation of three directories:

### `services/` — Source Snapshots

Component `.md` files copied by Forme during Phase 1. These are the service definitions as they were at wiring time — stable snapshots even if source files change during execution.

**Written by:** Forme (Phase 1)
**Read by:** The VM when constructing session prompts
**Immutable during execution.**

### `workspace/` — Private Working State

One subdirectory per service. Each service writes all its work here — intermediate notes, drafts, scratch data, and final output files.

**Written by:** Subagents (each service writes to its own subdirectory)
**Read by:** The VM reads only two things from workspace: declared `ensures` outputs (to copy to bindings) and `__error.md` (to detect errors). No other files are inspected during execution. Everything is preserved for post-run debugging.

The workspace is the service's private sandbox. It can contain anything:

```
workspace/researcher/
├── search-log.md           # What searches were attempted
├── raw-results.md          # Unfiltered search results
├── filtered-results.md     # After relevance filtering
├── notes.md                # Scratch thinking
├── findings.md             # Final output (ensures)
└── sources.md              # Final output (ensures)
```

Only the files named in the manifest's `outputs` section get copied to `bindings/`.

### `bindings/` — Public Interface

One subdirectory per service (plus `caller/` for inputs). Contains only declared `ensures` outputs — the public interface that downstream services consume.

**Written by:** The VM (copies from workspace after each service completes)
**Read by:** Downstream subagents (via input file paths in the manifest)

```
bindings/
├── caller/
│   └── question.md         # Input from the user
├── researcher/
│   ├── findings.md         # Copied from workspace/researcher/findings.md
│   └── sources.md          # Copied from workspace/researcher/sources.md
├── critic/
│   └── evaluation.md       # Copied from workspace/critic/evaluation.md
└── synthesizer/
    └── report.md           # Copied from workspace/synthesizer/report.md
```

---

## File Formats

### `manifest.md`

The wiring graph produced by Forme. See `forme.md` for the full format specification. Contains:

- Caller interface (requires/returns)
- Per-service entries (source, workspace, inputs with `←` mappings, outputs)
- Execution order with parallelization notes
- Warnings

**Written by:** Forme (Phase 1)
**Read by:** The VM (Phase 2)

### Caller Input Files

**Path:** `bindings/caller/{name}.md`

```markdown
# question

kind: input
source: caller

---

What are the latest developments in quantum computing?
```

**Written by:** The VM at program start (from CLI args, config, or user prompt)

### Service Output Files

**Path:** `workspace/{service}/{output-name}.md` (working copy)
**Path:** `bindings/{service}/{output-name}.md` (published copy)

Output files are simple Markdown — just the content. No special frontmatter required:

```markdown
# Findings

## Claim 1: Transformer architectures dominate NLP benchmarks
- Source: arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
- Confidence: 0.95

## Claim 2: Scaling laws predict performance from compute
- Source: arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361
- Confidence: 0.88
```

**Written by:** Subagent (to workspace). VM copies to bindings.

### Error Files

**Path:** `workspace/{service}/__error.md`

```markdown
# Error: no-results

No relevant sources found for the topic.

Searched:
- Google Scholar: 0 relevant results
- arXiv: 2 results, both tangential

Partial data: None available.
```

The `__` prefix signals to the VM that this is an error, not a regular output.

**Written by:** Subagent (when it cannot satisfy ensures)

---

## `state.md` — Append-Only Execution Log

The state file is an **append-only log** of execution events. The VM appends entries as execution progresses.

**Only the VM writes this file.** Subagents never modify `state.md`.

### Format

```markdown
# run:20260317-143052-a7b3c9 deep-research

1→ [input] question ✓
2→ researcher ✓
3→ ∥start critic,fact-checker
3a→ critic ✓
3b→ fact-checker ✓
3→ ∥done
4→ synthesizer ✓
---end 2026-03-17T14:35:22Z
```

### Event Markers

| Marker | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `N→ [input] name ✓` | Caller input bound | `1→ [input] question ✓` |
| `N→ service ✓` | Service completed, outputs copied to bindings | `2→ researcher ✓` |
| `N→ ∥start a,b` | Parallel services started | `3→ ∥start critic,fact-checker` |
| `Na→ a ✓` | Parallel service completed | `3a→ critic ✓` |
| `N→ ∥done` | All parallel services complete | `3→ ∥done` |
| `N→ service ✗ error-name` | Service signaled an error | `3→ researcher ✗ no-results` |
| `---end TIMESTAMP` | Program completed | `---end 2026-03-17T14:35:22Z` |
| `---error TIMESTAMP msg` | Program failed | `---error 2026-03-17T... no-results` |

### When the VM Writes

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Caller input bound | Append input marker |
| Service completes | Append completion marker |
| Parallel starts/joins | Append parallel markers |
| Error occurs | Append error marker |
| Program ends | Append end marker |

The VM does NOT rewrite the entire file. Each write is a single line append.

### Resumption

To resume an interrupted run:

1. Read `state.md` — find the last completed service
2. Read `manifest.md` — get the execution order
3. Scan `bindings/` — confirm existing outputs
4. Continue from the next service in execution order

---

## Who Writes What

| Artifact | Written By | When |
|----------|------------|------|
| `manifest.md` | Forme (Phase 1) | Before execution |
| `program.md` | Forme (Phase 1) | Before execution |
| `services/*.md` | Forme (Phase 1) | Before execution |
| `bindings/caller/*.md` | VM | At program start |
| `workspace/{service}/*` | Subagent | During service execution |
| `bindings/{service}/*` | VM (copy from workspace) | After service completes |
| `state.md` | VM | After each event |
| `agents/{name}/memory.md` | Persistent agent | During service execution |
| `agents/{name}/{name}-NNN.md` | Persistent agent | During service execution |

**Key principle:** The VM orchestrates and copies. Subagents write their own outputs to workspace. The VM publishes them to bindings. The VM never reads full output content — it tracks file paths and copies files.

---

## The Copy-on-Return Protocol

This is the core mechanism of Prose state management. When a service completes:

1. **Service writes** all its work to `workspace/{service}/`
2. **Service returns** a confirmation message listing its output files
3. **VM verifies** the listed outputs exist in workspace
4. **VM copies** each declared `ensures` output:
   `workspace/{service}/{output}.md` → `bindings/{service}/{output}.md`
5. **VM appends** completion marker to `state.md`

The copy is the "publish" step. Before the copy, the output exists only in the service's private workspace. After the copy, it's available to downstream services via `bindings/`.

If the service wrote `__error.md` instead:

1. **VM reads** `workspace/{service}/__error.md`
2. **VM checks** for conditional ensures clauses in the program
3. **VM either** handles the degraded case or propagates the error
4. **VM appends** error marker to `state.md`

---

## Agent Memory Files

### `agents/{name}/memory.md`

The agent's current accumulated state:

```markdown
# Agent Memory: captain

## Current Understanding

The project is implementing a research pipeline for quantum computing.
Researcher produces good breadth but sometimes lacks depth on subtopics.

## Decisions Made

- 2026-03-17: Approved initial research scope, flagged need for deeper source verification
- 2026-03-17: Set confidence threshold at 0.7 for claim inclusion

## Open Concerns

- Source diversity is low — too many arXiv papers, not enough industry reports
```

### `agents/{name}/{name}-NNN.md`

Historical segment records:

```markdown
# Segment 001

timestamp: 2026-03-17T14:32:15Z

## Summary

- Reviewed: researcher output (findings.md, sources.md)
- Found: 12 claims extracted, 3 below confidence threshold
- Decided: Accept 9 claims, request broader source search for rejected 3
- Next: Review critic evaluation, verify source diversity improved
```

### Memory Scoping

| Scope | Declaration | Path | Lifetime |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| Execution (default) | `persist: true` | `.prose/runs/{id}/agents/{name}/` | Dies with run |
| Project | `persist: project` | `.prose/agents/{name}/` | Survives runs |
| User | `persist: user` | `~/.prose/agents/{name}/` | Survives projects |

---

## `.prose/.env`

Simple key=value configuration:

```env
OPENPROSE_DEFAULT_MODEL=opus
OPENPROSE_MAX_PARALLEL=5
```

---

## Nested Program Imports

When a program imports and invokes another program (via registry or local file), the imported program runs in its own subdirectory:

```
.prose/runs/{id}/imports/{handle}--{slug}/
├── manifest.md
├── program.md
├── services/
├── workspace/
├── bindings/
├── state.md
├── imports/                    # Further nesting
│   └── ...
└── agents/
```

Same structure recursively, enabling unlimited nesting depth.

---

## Summary

Prose file-system state management is built on three directories:

1. **`services/`** — immutable source snapshots (what was wired)
2. **`workspace/`** — private working state (how each service did its work)
3. **`bindings/`** — public interface (what each service produced)

The manifest defines the graph. The VM walks it. Services write to workspace. The VM copies ensures outputs to bindings. State.md logs every event. Everything is on disk, everything is inspectable.
